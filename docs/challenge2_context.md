# DARPA Mathematical Challenge 2 Alignment

**Challenge 2:** *“Understand, predict, and control the dynamics of networks.”*

NIV translates this into an **economic control problem**:

1. **Understand:**  
   Identify latent variables governing fiscal and industrial throughput.  

2. **Predict:**  
   Simulate how friction and regeneration evolve through Laplacian-coupled agents.  

3. **Control:**  
   Apply adaptive or policy-driven \(u_t\) to maximize aggregate throughput and minimize systemic friction.

By embedding Treasury-level data into this formalism, the model connects abstract
network control theory to the empirical management of sovereign balance sheets.
